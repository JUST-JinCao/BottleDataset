# BottleDataset
The data set is obtained by experiment and can be used to classify  bottles and sundry. With a label, the data set is 1 for  bottles and -1 for sundry
This dataset is obtained with HOG and PCA algorithms, we got a version with 260-dimensional firstly, it has a perfect performance.
However, it can not highlight the advantage of the algorithm proposed by ourselves, thus the dataset version with 9-dimensional was created.
